Ceasar's strategy
(question time!)

---

Break huge problems into smaller parts.

---

Ceasar was a smart guy.
Let's implement this to our
organizational structure.

---

Segragation of duties:

* development
* operations
* product management
* QA
* ...

---

And that leads us to...

---[font=Inconsolata 100px][silos.jpg]
SILOS!

---[font=Inconsolata 100px][wall.png] [bottom]

"walls of confusion!"

---

Breaking down silos.

---

Buzzword: DevOps

---[silo_climb.png][top]

Create a team that will "master the devops"

---

A natural first step

---

et viola!

---[new_silo.png][bottom]

New silo!

---

You're doing it wrong!

---

Even with the best people
Devops is just another buzzword
if you don't have the right culture

---

Increased collaboration

---

Shared responsibility
